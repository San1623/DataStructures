Trees
Stack
Queue


what is an Algorithm?
Algorithm is a way to solve a particular problem

Types:
Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
Sorting: Quick Sort, Merge Sort


Must Know DSA topics:

Priority 3: Heap(min & max), Stack(LIFO), Queue


Terminology:
Time Complexity: Number of operations, how time grows when data grows
